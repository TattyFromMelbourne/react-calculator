Calculator built with React.js 

# Build

As well as the usual packages for React.js (I used the npm recommended `create-react-app`) you will also need to download the math.js package:-

```
npm install mathjs
```
See [http://mathjs.org/download.html](http://mathjs.org/download.html) for further details, if needed.
