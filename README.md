Calculator built with React.js

### Build

As well as the usual packages for React.js (e.g. use the npm recommended `create-react-app`) you will also need to download the `mathjs` package:-

```
npm install mathjs
```
See [http://mathjs.org/download.html](http://mathjs.org/download.html) for further details, if needed.
